<h2 id="orgheadline1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Memory Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
So far in programming C, we haven't given a lot of thought to the
variables we declare and what it actually means to declare a
variable of a given type. Recall that in C the notion of a type and
the amount of memory to store that type are strongly linked. For the
basic types we've looked at so far, here are their memory
requirements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>int</code> : integer number : 4-bytes</li>
<li><code>short</code> : integer number : 2-bytes</li>
<li><code>long</code> : integer number : 8-bytes</li>
<li><code>char</code> : character : 1-byte</li>
<li><code>float</code> : floating point number : 4-bytes</li>
<li><code>double</code> : floating point number : 8-bytes</li>
<li><code>void *</code> : pointers : 8-bytes on (64 bit machines)</li>
</ul>

<p>
But, what does it mean for a type to require memory, and where does
that memory come from and how is it managed? Understanding the
memory model in C is vital to becoming a good programmer because
there are situations where you have to use complex memory management
to write effective programs. Simple mistakes can lead to programs
with mysterious bugs that fail in inexplicable ways.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Local Memory Allocation on the Stack</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
When you declare a variable, you are actually stating to C that you
need to create space for the data of that variable to
exist. Consider a very simple example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span> = 10;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The declaration of the integer <code>a</code> will allocate memory for the
storage for an integer (4-bytes). We refer to the data stored in
memory via the variable <code>a</code>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Memory allocation</b> refers to the process by which the program makes
"space" for the storage of data. When you declare a variable of a
type, enough memory is allocation locally to store data of that
type. The allocation is local, occurring within the scope of the
function, and when that function returns the memory is
<b>deallocated</b>. This should be intuitive based on your experience
with programming so far, you can't referenced a variable outside the
scope of your function.
</p>

<p>
However with pointers in C, it's easy to make mistakes where your
pointer references a memory address out of scope of the current
function or even completely unallocated memory. As an example of a
common mistake, consider the simple program below which has a
function <code>plus()</code> which adds two numbers and returns a memory
address for the result value.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span id="coderef-plus" class="coderef-off"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> * <span style="color: #87cefa;">plus</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">b</span>){</span>

                <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">locally declared c</span>
}

<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">main</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">argc</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">argv</span>[]){
<span id="coderef-assign" class="coderef-off">  <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span> = plus(1,2);</span>
<span id="coderef-bad_ref" class="coderef-off">  printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d\n"</span>,*p); <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">dereference return value</span></span>
                     <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">to print an integer </span>
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The function <a href="#coderef-plus" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-plus');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-plus');">plus</a> is declared to take two integers as arguments and
return a pointer to an integer. Within the body of the function, the
two integers are summed together, and the result in stored in <code>c</code>, a
variable <a href="#coderef-c_declare" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-c_declare');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-c_declare');">declared locally</a> within the context of the function. The
function then <a href="#coderef-c_returned" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-c_returned');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-c_returned');">returns the memory address</a> of <code>c</code>, which is assigned
to the pointer value <code>p</code> in <a href="#coderef-assign" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-assign');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-assign');">main</a>. 
</p>

<p>
What's the problem? The memory of <code>c</code> is deallocated once the
function returns, and now <code>p</code> is referencing a memory address which
is unallocated. The <a href="#coderef-bad_ref" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-bad_ref');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-bad_ref');">print statement</a>, which deferences <code>p</code>,
following the pointer to the memory address, may fail. The above
code is <b>bad</b>, and you can also follow the reasoning with a stack
diagram.
</p>

                c exists locally    returning a reference       When p is dereferenced
                in plus()           to c assined to p           it points to unallocated memory
</pre>

<p>
First, in <code>main()</code>, p waits for the result of the call to <code>plus()</code>,
which set's <code>c</code>. Once <code>plus()</code> returns, the value of <code>p</code> references
a variable declared in <code>plus()</code>, but all locally declared variables
in <code>plus()</code> are deallocated once <code>plus()</code> returns. That means, by
the time the <code>printf()</code> is called and <code>p</code> is dereferenced, the
memory address references unallocated memory, and we cannot
guarantee that the data at that memory address will be what we
expect.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> The Stack</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Another term for local memory allocation is <b>stack allocation</b>
because the way programs track execution across functions is based
on a stack. A <b>stack</b> is a standard ordred data structure, like a
list, that has the property that the <i>last item</i> inserted on the
stack is the <i>first item</i> that is removed. This is often referred
to as LIFO data structure, last-in-first-out.  A stack has two
primary functions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>push</b> : push an item on to the top of the stack</li>
<li><b>pop</b>  : pop an item off the top of the stack</li>
</ul>

<p>
The stack's <b>top</b> always references the last item pushed onto the
stack, and the items below the top are ordered base on when they
were pushed on. The most recently pushed items come first. This
means when you pop items off the top stack, the next item becomes the
next top, which maintains the LIFO principle. 
</p>

<p>
The stack model (last-in-first-out) matches closely the model of
function calls and returns during program execution. The act of
calling a function is the same as <i>pushing</i> the called function
execution onto the top of the stack, and, once that function
completes, the results are returned <i>popping</i> the function off the
stack.
</p>

<p>
Each function is contained within a structure on the stack called a
<b>stack frame</b>. A stack frame contains all the allocated memory from
variable deliberations as well as a pointer to the execution point
of the calling function, the so called <b>return pointer</b>. A very
common exploit in computer security is a buffer overflow attack
where an attacker overwrite the return pointer such that when the
function returns, code chosen by the attacker is executed. 
</p>

<p>
To understand how function calls are modeled in the stack, we have
nested function calls under <code>addonetwo()</code>, and which ever function
is currently executing has the stack frame at the top of the stack
and the calling function, where to the current function returns, is
the stack frame next from top. When the current function returns,
its stack frame is popped off the stack, and the calling function,
now the top of the stack, continues executing from the point of
function call.

<p>
The act of pushing and popping functions onto the stack also
affects the memory allocation. By <i>pushing</i> a function onto the
stack, the computer is actually allocating memory for the
function's local variables, and once that function returns, the
function and its allocated memory is <i>popped</i> off the stack,
deallocating it. This is why local declared variables are also
called <b>stacked variables</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Following the example from before we can now better understand why
it fails by adding in the pushes and pops of the stack. 
</p>

<h2 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Global Memory Allocation on the Heap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Just because the sample program with <code>plus()</code> from the previous
section doesn't work properly when returning a memory reference, it
does not mean you cannot write functions that return a memory
reference. What is needed is a different allocation procedure for
global memory which is not deallocated automatically when functions
return and thus remains in scope for the entirety of the program
execution.
</p>

<p>
In fact, you have already seen how to do this in C++ when you using
the <code>new</code> construct. When you call <b>new</b> for some structure, what
is actually going on? Consider the small code snippet below:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c++"><span style="color: #98fb98;">Node</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">node</span> = <span style="color: #00ffff;">new</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">Node</span>();
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The local variable declaration is for the variable <code>node</code>, but
that's just a pointer to some memory. The variable <code>node</code>, itself,
is declared on the stack and has enough memory to store a memory
address. The value of that memory address is set by the return of
the call <code>new Node()</code>. The <code>new</code> function will automatically
allocate enough memory to store a <code>Node</code> structure and the <code>node</code>
variable now references that memory. But, where does this new
memory come from?
</p>

<p>
If you think about it, the memory cannot have been allocated on the
stack because it is memory being returned from a function, the
<code>new</code> function. As we've seen previously, if a function returns a
local reference of a variable declared on the stack, that memory is
automatically deallocated when the function returns. Instead, this
memory must have been allocated somewhere else, and it is. The
<code>new</code> function performs a dynamic memory allocation in global
memory that is not associated with scope of functions or the
stack. It is instead allocating on the <b>heap</b>. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> The heap, <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The global memory region for a program is called the <b>heap</b>, which
is a fragmented data structure where new allocation try and fit
within unallocated regions. Whenever a program needs to allocate
memory globally or in a dynamic way, that memory is allocated on
the heap, which is shared across the entire program irrespective of
function calls.
</p>

<p>
In C the <code>new</code> function is called <code>malloc()</code>, or memory
allocator. The <code>malloc()</code> function takes the number of bytes to be
allocated as its argument, and it returns a pointer to a memory
region on the heap of the requested byte-size. Here is a code
snippet to allocate memory to store an integer on the heap:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">//                           </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">.--- Allocate sizeof(int) number of bytes </span>
<span style="color: #ff7f24;">//                           </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">v</span>
 <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span> = (<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *) malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));
<span style="color: #ff7f24;">//            </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">^</span>
<span style="color: #ff7f24;">//            </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">'-- Cast to a integer pointer</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
First, to allocate an integer on the heap, we have to know how
<b>big</b> an integer is, that is, what size is it, which we learn via
<code>sizeof()</code> macro. Since an <code>int</code> is 4 byes in size, <code>malloc()</code> will
allocate 4 bytes of memory on the heap in which an integer can be
stored. <code>malloc()</code> then returns the memory address of the newly
allocated memory, which is assigned to <code>p</code>. Since <code>malloc()</code> is a
general purpose allocation tool, just allocating bytes which can be
used to store data generally, we have to cast the resulting pointer
value to the right type, <code>int *</code>. If we don't, the program won't
fail, but you will get a compiler warning.
</p>

<p>
We can now use <code>p</code> like a standard pointer as before; however, once
we're done with <code>p</code> we have to explicitly deallocate it. Unlike
stack based memory allocations which are implicitly deallocated
when functions return, there is no way for C to know when you are
done using memory allocated on the heap. C does not track
references, like Java, so it can't perform garbage collection;
instead, you, the programmer, must indicate when you're done with
the memory by <i>freeing</i>. The deallocation function is <code>free()</code>
(equivalent to <code>delete</code> in C++), which takes a pointer value as
input and "frees" the referenced memory on the heap. 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span> = (<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *) malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));

free(p); <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">&lt;-- deallocate p</span>
</pre>
</div>


<p>
With all of that, we can now complete the <code>plus()</code> program to
properly return a memory reference to the result. 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<h3 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Memory Leaks  and other Memory Violations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
In C (and C++), the programer is responsible for memory management,
which includes both the allocation and deallocation of memory. As a
result, there are many mistakes that can be made, which is natural
considering that all programers make mistakes. Perhaps the most
common mistake is a memory leak, where heap allocated memory is not
freed. Consider the following program.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">main</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">argc</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">argv</span>[]){
  <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">i</span>, * <span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span>;

  <span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span>(i=0;i&gt;100;i++){
<span id="coderef-memlost" class="coderef-off">    p = (<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *) malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));</span>
    *p = i;
  }

}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
At the malloc, on <a href="#coderef-memlost" class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-memlost');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-memlost');">Line 5</a>, the returned pointer to newly
allocated memory is overwriting the previous value of <code>p</code>. There is
no <code>free()</code> occuring, and once the previous pointer value is
overwritten, there is no way to free that memory. It is considered
<i>lost</i>, and the above program has a memory leak.  Memory leaks are
very bad, and over time, can cause your program to fail.
</p>

<p>
Another common mistake is dereferencing a <b>dangling pointer</b>. A
dangling poiner is when a pointer value once referenced allocated
memory, but that memory has seen been dealocated. We'e seen an
example of this already in the <code>plus()</code> program, but it can also
occur for heap allocations.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">main</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">argc</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">argv</span>[]){
  <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span> = (<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *) malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));
  <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">... code</span>
  free(p);
  <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">... code  </span>
  *p = 10;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once <code>p</code> has been freed, the memory referenced by the <code>p</code>'s value
can be reclaimed by other allocations. At the point where <code>p</code> is
dereferenced for the assignment, it might be the case that you are
actually overwriting memory for some other value, and corrupting
your program. Once memory is freed, it should never be
dereferenced. These kinds of memory violations can lead to the
dreaded <code>SEGFAULT</code>.
</p>

<p>
Another, common mistake with memory allocation is a <b>double
free</b>. The heap allocation functions maintain special data
structures so that it is easy to find unallocated memory and
reallocate for future <code>malloc()</code> calls. If you call <code>free()</code> twice
on a pointer, you will corrupt that process, result in a <code>core
   dump</code> or some other very scary error.

<h2 id="orgheadline9"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Program Layout: Stack vs. Heap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Now that you understand the two different memory allocation
procedures, let's zoom out and take a larger look at how memory in
programs is managed more generally. Where is the stack? Where is the
heap? How do they grow or shrink?
</p>

<p>
To answer these questions, you first need to think of a program as a
memory profile. All information about a program, including the
actual binary code and variables all are within the memory layout of
a program. When executing, the Operating System will manage that
memory layout, and a snapshot of that memory and the current
execution point basically defines a program. This allows the
operating system to swap in and out programs as needed.
</p>

<p>
On 64-bit machines, the total available memory addresses are from 0
to 2<sup>64</sup>-1. For a program, the top and bottom of the address space
are what is important. We can look at the program's memory layout in
diagram form:
</p>

<pre class="example">     2^64-1---&gt;  .----------------------.
High Addresses   |      Enviroment      |
                 |----------------------|
                 |                      |   Functions and variable are declared

                 :                      :
                 .                      .   The stack grows down into unused space
                 .         Empty        .   while the heap grows up. 
                 .                      .
                 .                      .   (other memory maps do occur here, such 
                 .                      .    as dynamic libraries, and different memory
                 :                      :    alloocat)
                 |           ^          |
                 |           |          |
 break point -&gt;  | - - - - - - - - - - -|   Dynamic memory is declared on the heap

                 |          BSS         |   The compiled binary code is down here as

Low Addresses    |          Text        |
      0 -----&gt;   '----------------------'  
</pre>



<p>
At the higher addresses is the stack and at the lower address is the
heap. The two memory allocation regions grow into the middle of the
address space, which is unused and unallocated. In this way, the two
allocations will not interfere with each other.  The stack <b>base
pointer</b> is the current top of the stack, and as functions are
called and returned, it will shift appropriately. The <b>break point</b>
refers to the top of the programs data segment, which contains the
heap. As the heap fills up, requirement more space, the break is set
to higher addresses. 
</p>

<p>
You should note that this memory layout is <b>virtual</b>. From the
program's perspective it has access to the entire address range, but
in reality, this might not be the case because the program is
sharing <b>physical memory</b> with other programs, including the
operating system. How that process works is a discussion for another
class.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Memory Mapping and Dynamic Libraries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Between the break point and the base pointer is unallocated memory,
but it may not be unused. This region can be memory mapped, which is
the process of loading data directly from files into memory. As the
programmer, you can directly memory map files, but often this is
done automatically for you when you read and write files.
</p>

<p>
Another common use for the middle addresses is the loading of
dynamic shared libraries. When you make a call to a function like
<code>printf()</code> or <code>malloc()</code>, the code for those functions exist in
shared libraries, the standard C library, to be precise. Your
program must run that code, but the operating system doesn't want to
have load more code into memory than needed. Instead, the O.S. loads
shared libraries dynamically, and when it does so, it maps the
necessary code into the middle address spaces.

<h3 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Address Space Randomization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
A final note about program memory address is that it is not
consistent across runs. Take a look at the very simple program:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">/*</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">random.c</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">main</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">argc</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> * <span style="color: #eedd82;">argv</span>[]){
  <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>;
  printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"0x%p\n"</span>,&amp;a); <span style="color: #ff7f24;">//</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">print the address of a                                                                                                                        </span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
All this program does is print the address of the statically
declared variable <code>a</code>. With your knowledge of the memory address
layout, you could probably say with confidence that the address
value should be a relatively large number, but you might also
expect that it would be consistent across runs of the program. 
</p>

<pre class="example">#&gt; for i in `seq 1 1 10`; do ./random; done
0x0x7fff58e0cafc
0x0x7fff50fffafc
0x0x7fff59a6dafc
0x0x7fff508c3afc
0x0x7fff533c8afc
0x0x7fff539a9afc
0x0x7fff528c6afc
0x0x7fff50984afc
0x0x7fff52f13afc
0x0x7fff5c97aafc
</pre>


<p>
In fact, it is not consistent. While the addresses are relatively
high in the address space, there least significant bits are quite
random. This is on purpose, and for security purposes. The stack
values also contain important pointers to next bit of code that
should be executed, this is how program knows how to return to the
previous execution prior to the function call. In a buffer overflow
attack, the attacker overwrites the return pointer allowing code to
be executed of the attacker's choosing, which can be exploit
code. In order for the attack to be successful, the attacker must
know exactly where in the program to set the return pointer, but if
the addresses are randomized, this because a much more difficult
tasks. Which is why the address space is randomized.
