The static variable is initialized only once.
initialized static variables are stored in the data segment of the C program whereas uninitialized ones are stored in the BSS segment.

Another information about static: If a variable is global and static, it has the life time of the C program, but it has file scope.
 It is visible only in that file.

  $gcc file.c
