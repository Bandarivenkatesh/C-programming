    Local variables and function frame - stack

    Global and static variables if uninitialized - .bss block start by symbol

    Global and static variables if initialized - data segment

    Environment variables and arguments - on top of the stack

    Dynamic data allocation - heap

    Const - ROM

    Volatile - no storage

    Register - cpu register

    Const volatile - in the same place as const storage



  heap (growing up) 
  ...
  stack (growing down)
